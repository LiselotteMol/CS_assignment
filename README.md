# CS_assignment

This repository has been set up for the assignment of the Computer Science for Business Analytics course (FEM21037). The repository consists of the following documents:
- Data excel
- CS Final
- Bootstrap 1
- Bootstrap 2
- Bootstrap 3
- Bootstrap 4
- Bootstrap 5

**Assignment description**
The assignment asks to create a Scalable Product Duplicate Detection Method. This has been done by applying Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) and then Hierarchical Clustering algorithm to the data. 


**Data excel:**
  Data excel consists of the data set that is used for this assignment. The data is obtained via https://personal.eur.nl/frasincar/datasets/TVs-all-merged.zip and transformed into an excel format. 
  
**CS Final:**
This file contains all the methods and functions needed for this project. It is important that first lines 1 until 125 are run before performing the bootstraps. Here, the data is not split yet. That comes in the other files. Also, the functions that are at the bottom of the files need to be run. 

**Bootstrap 1**:
When the CS final has been run for the determined lines, the bootstraps can be executed. It is possible to run the entire script for each document but not necessary, as this has already been computed, when running CS final. Therefore, start running from lines 72 until the end of the script. 

**Bootstrap 2, 3, 4, 5:**
The explanation is the same as for Bootstrap 1.

After running the bootstraps it is important to return to the CS final to calculate the plots. This can be done by running from line 127 until 148. The results are now shown in clear plots.
